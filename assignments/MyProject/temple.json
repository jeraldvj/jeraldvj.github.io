        "The Cochabamba Bolivia Temple is the 82nd operating temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).",
        "Bolivia's first convert to the LDS Church was baptized in December 1964, a month after missionaries first arrived. Forty-four years later there were over 158,000 members across the country.",
        "In 1995, the church announced that a temple would be built in the Bolivian city of Cochabamba. The next year, church president Gordon B. Hinckley presided over the groundbreaking. He addressed the 4,000 people gathered during one of the heaviest rainstorms the area had seen in ten years. He addressed the gathering, 'My beloved and wet brothers and sisters'.",
        "Before the temple was dedicated it was open for one week to allow the public to tour the temple. Originally the temple open house had been scheduled for two weeks, but because of civil unrest in the city of Cochabamba, due to an ill-fated attempt to privatize the municipal water supply (Cochabamba protests of 2000), the first week was cancelled. LDS Church leaders were pleased when nearly 65,000 people toured the temple, coming close to the goal of 75,000. Because of the open house, over 2,200 people requested to be visited by the Mormon missionaries.",
        "Hinckley dedicated the Cochabamba Bolivia Temple in four sessions on April 30, 2000. In the dedicatory prayer, Hinckley recognized the founder of Bolivia, Simón Bolívar, who died the year the church was organized.",
        "The Cochabama Bolivia Temple is of classic modern design reflecting the Bolivian culture. The exterior is finished with a blend of hand-hewn granite and plaster. A statue of the angel Moroni tops the single tower. It has a total of 33,302 square feet (3,093.9 m²), two ordinance rooms, and three sealing rooms."

Located in the Brazilian city of São Paulo, it was the first LDS temple built in South America, and also the first temple to use the single story, single spire design. The spire is 101 feet (31 m) tall.",
        "The intention to construct a temple in São Paulo was announced by the LDS Church on March 1, 1975, with construction beginning twelve months later. Hundreds of local church members gathered to clear the site, which included removing brush, weeds, and banana trees. Hundreds more members donated their time to produce fifty thousand blocks of cast stone composed of quartz, marble chips, and white concrete for the exterior of the temple. It was dedicated on October 30, 1978, by church president Spencer W. Kimball. The temple has two ordinance rooms and four sealing rooms, and has a total floor area of 59,246 square feet (5,504 m²).",
        "On August 20, 2003, a gold-leafed statue of the angel Moroni was added to the temple during an extensive renovation and enlargement project 25 years after its dedication. Church president Gordon B. Hinckley rededicated the São Paulo Brazil Temple on February 22, 2004."
